316. Remove Duplicate Letters

Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is 
the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

Example 1:

Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"

var removeDuplicateLetters = function(s) {
   let lastOccurrence = {};
    let stack = [];

    // Store the last occurrence index of each character in the string
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        lastOccurrence[s[i]] = i;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let char = s[i];

        // Skip if the character is already in the stack
        if (stack.includes(char)) continue;

        // If the current character is smaller than the top of the stack and there's another occurrence of the top character later in the string
        while (stack.length > 0 && char < stack[stack.length - 1] && i < lastOccurrence[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            stack.pop(); // Pop the top character from the stack
        }

        stack.push(char); // Push the current character to the stack
    }

    return stack.join('');
};
